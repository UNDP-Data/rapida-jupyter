    "---\n",
    "he Global Gridded Relative Deprivation Index (GRDI), Version 1, provides a detailed picture of relative deprivation and \n",
    "poverty worldwide, mapped at a high spatial resolution of approximately 1 km¬≤. The index ranges from 0 (least deprived) \n",
    "to 100 (most deprived). It is built using a combination of demographic and satellite data, carefully processed to ensure\n",
    "consistency across different regions. To create GRDI, six key factors were selected to represent different aspects of \n",
    "deprivation, such as economic activity, child mortality, and human development. The dataset covers the entire globe, \n",
    "integrating the best available data at either a fine-scale grid level or broader administrative boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "GRDI combines six key indicators to assess deprivation levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Built-up Area Ratio (BUILT): Measures the proportion of land covered by buildings compared to open land. Lower values\n",
    "    indicate higher deprivation, as rural areas tend to have fewer economic opportunities.¬π\n",
    "2. Child Dependency Ratio (CDR): The number of children (aged 0‚Äì14) per 100 working-age adults (15‚Äì64). \n",
    "   A higher ratio suggests higher deprivation due to greater economic strain on households.¬≤\n",
    "3. Infant Mortality Rate (IMR): The number of infant deaths (under one year old) per 1,000 live births. \n",
    "   A higher IMR indicates poorer health conditions and higher deprivation.\n",
    "4. Subnational Human Development Index (SHDI): A local version of the Human Development Index (HDI), considering education,\n",
    "health, and living standards. Lower SHDI scores reflect higher deprivation.¬≥\n",
    "5. Nighttime Lights (VNL, 2020): Measures light intensity at night, which is often linked to economic activity and infrastructure. \n",
    "   Areas with less artificial light tend to have higher deprivation.‚Å¥\n",
    "6. Nighttime Lights Trend (VNL Slope, 2012‚Äì2020): Tracks changes in nighttime lights over time. \n",
    "   A decline in brightness suggests worsening deprivation, while an increase indicates economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset can be used to:\n",
    "- identify areas with high deprivation to guide poverty reduction efforts\n",
    "- map socioeconomic inequalities at fine spatial scales\n",

    "from 2015 to 2100, fully aligned with the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). \n",

    "long-term economic modeling under diverse socioeconomic scenarios.\n",
    "The dataset was up-sampled to 1km resolution and reprojected to [EPSG:3857](https://epsg.io/3857) to facilitate web usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct a spatially explicit and globally consistent GDP dataset aligned with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), \n",
    "the authors began by collecting national-level GDP projections for each of the five SSP scenarios. These projections, \n",
    "expressed in both constant 2015 U.S. dollars and purchasing power parity (PPP), were sourced from authoritative institutions \n",
    "such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Institute for \n",
    "Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, population data at 0.1¬∞ resolution were obtained from the SSP Public Database. \n",
    "These gridded population distributions were used as the basis for disaggregating national GDP values. \n",
    "The key assumption underpinning the downscaling process was that GDP per capita remains spatially uniform within each \n",
    "country for a given year. Based on this, national GDP totals were allocated across grid cells in direct proportion to the\n",
    "local population count. This method produced a high-resolution, annual global GDP dataset spanning from 2015 to 2100, \n",
    "consistent with the spatial and temporal dynamics of each SSP scenario. \n",
    "The resulting data are well-suited for use in integrated assessment models, climate impact studies, land-use modeling, and other applications requiring detailed socioeconomic projections.\n",
